# Nike-bot
This is a Nike bot created by Wenyu She. This bot is used on the Nike SNKRS website to buy highly demanded sneakers with high resale value. When Nike releases a sneaker, this bot automatically buys the sneaker through as many accounts as possible during the ten minute Nike raffle process.

Functions of this bot include:
- running the moment Nike releases a sneaker
- changing the IP address for every account entered in the raffle
- going through the entire checkout process (selecting shoe size, filling out address/payment info, etc)
